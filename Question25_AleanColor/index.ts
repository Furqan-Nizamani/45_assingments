/*

Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

// Alien color

let alien_color = "green"

// Passes the test
if(alien_color == "green"){
    console.log("CONGRATUCALTION YOU WIN 5 POINTS");

}
else{
    console.log("You chosed wrong color");
    
}

// false the test

if(alien_color == "red"){
    console.log("CONGRATUCALTION YOU WIN 5 POINTS");
    
}

// In this question in the 2nd statement it will never show the answer
